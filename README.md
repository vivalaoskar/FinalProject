# FinalProject
## GUI Project Tkinter in Python

For the final project, I created the right tool that everyone can use. But in Windows itself, it is present when viewing pictures.

If in the future to finalize this project, then you can release a full-fledged application.

Used the Tkinter and Pillow library to work on files.

The code is still raw and some features need to be added. But in general, it works.

What this code can do:
- Import images in png format. jpegs. jpg.
- Cut pictures to a convenient proportion for you
- Save the image in a convenient location.
